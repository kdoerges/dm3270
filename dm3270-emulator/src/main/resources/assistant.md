###File Transfers
To display the File Transfers window use cmd-t. This window keeps track of datasets that have been displayed, jobs that have been submitted, and the output from those jobs. From here you can transfer files to and from the mainframe.

The TSO Command field on each screen will build a transfer command based on the current selection. This command can be edited before it is issued if you want to alter it. Press the execute button to issue the command. If the button is greyed out that means the command cannot be issued at the present time.
![Batch Jobs](assistant2.png?raw=true "Batch Jobs")  
The transfer tab has two purposes. Firstly to display datasets and job output that has just been transferred, and secondly to show the contents of a particular folder on your computer that contains files you may wish to transfer back to the mainframe. Presently that folder is 'dm3270/files' in your home folder. The default command on this tab is a PUT command, but all of the TSO commands can be edited before sending.
