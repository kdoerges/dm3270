### Functions
Four functions are available in Debug Mode - Spy, Replay, Terminal and Test. To enable Debug Mode you need to select it from the [Mode menu](menus.md).

Note that the Folder button next to the Replay files list is to identify the **folder** that contains the saved session files. All of the files in this folder that match the name 'spy99.txt' (where 99 is any two digit number) will be added to the files list.

#### Spy Function
Waits for a terminal emulator to connect to the client, and then it completes the connection to the server. The mainframe session can be used as normal, however all communication buffers are collected and can be saved in a session file to replay later. For security purposes the file can be saved with all user input redacted, in order to prevent any passwords being saved. The session file should be named spy99.txt, where 99 is any two-digit number.

#### Replay Function
Uses the dm3270 terminal to replay the commands that were previously recorded in a session file. Individual buffers can be selected and examined. The anticipated reply message (if any) is also displayed. Each command (both client and server) is sent to the terminal for processing.

#### Test Function
Waits for a terminal emulator to connect to the client port specifed. The program is now acting as a server, and it can be used to send the terminal various 3270 commands. Used together with the Spy window so that all buffers can be displayed, and saved if required.
